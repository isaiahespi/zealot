# Course Description

Consider a brief description of the course to give students a broad sense of what the course is all about.  Research indicates that writing in a welcoming tone can help students engage with a syllabus more deeply. You might provide some context for the course that helps students understand why they would take it and how it fits into a particular sequence or major requirement (if applicable). You could also explain how the course relates to future career paths, and whether there are any prerequisites for the course.

## Learning Outcomes 

After successfully completing this course you will be able to:

- State three to five outcomes that you expect your students will achieve as a result of this class.
- Outcomes should be clear and measurable and worded around what students do (e.g., define, contrast, apply, analyze, create, evaluate).
- If your course carries a [General Education designation, review the learning outcomes here](https://gened.umd.edu/faculty/general-education-learning-outcomes-and-assessment-rubrics)


## Required Resources 


- Course Website: [elms.umd.edu](elms.umd.edu)
- Book: (Indicate that the book is required or recommended. Include ISBN number and estimated costs)
- Application/Software (Indicate that the product is required or recommended. Include the product link and estimated costs). If required and if the application/software has NOT been reviewed by the UMD IT to assess security compliance (accessibility and privacy), please provide an alternative solution for the students to equally succeed and meet the course requirements.
- Total Estimated costs of required course materials: $\$XX.XX$

## Course Structure

Explain the structure of the course here including elements of how the work outside and inside the class should be balanced. 

Example: This course has 4 live-sessions via WebEx that are mandatory. The flexible framework does not require you to be in a specific location to participate; however, you must have access to a full-screen computer or tablet for each live session. (If you use a tablet for the live session, you must be comfortable typing responses on it.) The online nature of this class will push you to take an active role in the learning process. You will do this by engaging and collaborating with other students and the instructor on a regular basis both, in live sessions, as well as through group work and activities.

## Tips for Success in an Online Course

1. Participate. Discussions and group work are a critical part of the course, and I invite you to engage deeply, ask questions, and talk about the course content with your classmates. You can learn a great deal from discussing ideas and perspectives with your peers and professor. Participation can also help you articulate your thoughts and develop critical thinking skills.
2. Manage your time. Students are often very busy, and I understand that you have obligations outside of this class. However, it’s important that I note that students do best when they have adequate time to devote to the class. Schedule time for your online learning and participation in discussions each week. Give yourself plenty of time to complete assignments including extra time to handle any technology related problems.
3. Login regularly. I recommend that you log in to ELMS-Canvas several times a week to view announcements, discussion posts and replies to your posts. You may need to log in multiple times a day when group submissions are due.
4. Do not fall behind. This class moves at a quick pace and each week builds on the previous content. If you feel you are starting to fall behind, check in with the instructor as soon as possible so we can troubleshoot together. It will be hard to keep up with the course content if you fall behind in the pre-work or post-work.
5. Use ELMS-Canvas notification settings. Pro tip! Canvas ELMS-Canvas can ensure you receive timely notifications in your email or via text. Be sure to enable announcements to be sent instantly or daily.
6. Ask for help if needed. If you need help with ELMS-Canvas or other technology, IT Support. If you are struggling with a course concept, reach out to me and your classmates for support.

# Course Guidelines

## Names/Pronouns and Self-Identifications:

The University of Maryland recognizes the importance of a diverse student body, and we are committed to fostering inclusive and equitable classroom environments. I invite you, if you wish, to tell us how you want to be referred to in this class, both in terms of your name and your pronouns (he/him, she/her, they/them, etc.). Keep in mind that the pronouns someone uses are not necessarily indicative of their gender identity. Visit [trans.umd.edu](trans.umd.edu) to learn more.

Additionally, it is your choice whether to disclose how you identify in terms of your gender, race, class, sexuality, religion, and dis/ability, among all aspects of your identity (e.g., should it come up in classroom conversation about our experiences and perspectives) and should be self-identified, not presumed or imposed.  I will do my best to address and refer to all students accordingly, and I ask you to do the same for all of your fellow Terps.

## Communication with Instructor:

**Email**: If you need to reach out and communicate with me, please email me at [your.email@umd.edu](your.email@umd.edu). Please DO NOT email me with questions that are easily found in the syllabus or on ELMS (i.e. When is this assignment due? How much is it worth? etc.) but please DO reach out about personal, academic, and intellectual concerns/questions.
While I will do my best to respond to emails within 24 hours, you will more likely receive email responses from me on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 8:00am-10:00am EST

**ELMS**: I will send IMPORTANT announcements via ELMS messaging. You must make sure that your email & announcement notifications (including changes in assignments and/or due dates) are enabled in ELMS so you do not miss any messages.  You are responsible for checking your email and Canvas/ELMS inbox with regular frequency.

## Communication with Peers:

With a diversity of perspectives and experience, we may find ourselves in disagreement and/or debate with one another. As such, it is important that we agree to conduct ourselves in a professional manner and that we work together to foster and preserve a virtual classroom environment in which we can respectfully discuss and deliberate controversial questions. I encourage you to confidently exercise your right to free speech—bearing in mind, of course, that you will be expected to craft and defend arguments that support your position. Keep in mind, that free speech has its limit and this course is NOT the space for hate speech, harassment, and derogatory language. I will make every reasonable attempt to create an atmosphere in which each student feels comfortable voicing their argument without fear of being personally attacked, mocked, demeaned, or devalued.

Any behavior (including harassment, sexual harassment, and racially and/or culturally derogatory language) that threatens this atmosphere will not be tolerated. Please alert me immediately if you feel threatened, dismissed, or silenced at any point during our semester together and/or if your engagement in discussion has been in some way hindered by the learning environment.

# Academic Integrity

Describe your expectations for academic integrity. The following is sample text regarding the use of Turnitin: 

For this course, some of your assignments will be collected via Turnitin on our course ELMS page.  I have chosen to use this tool because it can help you improve your scholarly writing and help me verify the integrity of student work.  For information about Turnitin, how it works, and the feedback reports you may have access to, visit [Turnitin Originality Checker for Students](https://umd.service-now.com/itsc?id=kb_article&sys_id=c0116d8f0f7ef2007f232ca8b1050e63)

The University's Code of Academic Integrity is designed to ensure that the principles of academic honesty and integrity are upheld. In accordance with this code, the University of Maryland does not tolerate academic dishonesty. Please ensure that you fully understand this code and its implications because all acts of academic dishonesty will be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of this code. All students are expected to adhere to this Code. It is your responsibility to read it and know what it says, so you can start your professional life on the right path. **As future professionals, your commitment to high ethical standards and honesty begins with your time at the University of Maryland.** It is important to note that course assistance websites, such as `CourseHero`, are not permitted sources, unless the instructor explicitly gives permission for you to use one of these sites. Material taken or copied from these sites can be deemed unauthorized material and a violation of academic integrity. These sites offer information that might not be accurate and that shortcut the learning process, particularly the critical thinking steps necessary for college-level assignments. Additionally, students may naturally choose to use online forums for course-wide discussions (e.g., Group lists or chats) to discuss concepts in the course. However, collaboration on graded assignments is strictly prohibited unless otherwise stated. Examples of prohibited collaboration include: asking classmates for answers on quizzes or exams, asking for access codes to clicker polls, etc. Please visit the [Office of Undergraduate Studies’ full list of campus-wide policies](http://www.ugst.umd.edu/courserelatedpolicies.html) and reach out if you have questions.

Finally, on each exam or assignment you must write out and sign the following pledge:

> **"I pledge on my honor that I have not given or received any unauthorized assistance on this exam/assignment."**

If you ever feel pressured to comply with someone else’s academic integrity violation, please reach out to me straight away. Also, **if you are ever unclear** about acceptable levels of collaboration, **please ask**!

# Grades

Campus Policy dictates that you must specify:

- How final letter grades will be determined. This should include a breakdown of all graded assessments, their weight in the course, and whether final grades will include $\pm$ descriptors.
- How students will have access to their grades throughout the semester, and how they can review their work (including the final exam).

All assessment scores will be posted on the course ELMS page.  If you would like to review any of your grades (including the exams), or have questions about how something was scored, please email me to schedule a time for us to meet and discuss.

Late work will not be accepted for course credit so please plan to have it submitted well before the scheduled deadline. I am happy to discuss any of your grades with you, and if I have made a mistake I will immediately correct it. Any formal grade disputes must be submitted in writing and within one week of receiving the grade. Final letter grades are assigned based on the percentage of total assessment points earned. To be fair to everyone I have to establish clear standards and apply them consistently, so please understand that being close to a cutoff is not the same as making the cut ($89.99 \neq 90.00$).  It would be unethical to make exceptions for some and not others.

 A table of the assessments and point values can be a concise way to convey all of the graded elements and their relative weight in the course.  If you are using weighted percentages (e.g., exams = 30%, paper = 20%) be sure to clarify the number of assessments within each category… is there one exam worth 30% or are there three exams that are each worth 10. 

It is essential that you articulate in your syllabus how final letter grades will be assigned. There is no campus policy on percentages and letter grades, nor is there a requirement that you utilize a points-based scheme.




# Resources & Accommodations

## Accessibility and Disability Services 


The University of Maryland is committed to creating and maintaining a welcoming and inclusive educational, working, and living environment for people of all abilities. The University of Maryland is also committed to the principle that no qualified individual with a disability shall, on the basis of disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of the University, or be subjected to discrimination. The [Accessibility and Disability Service (ADS)](https://www.counseling.umd.edu/ads/) provides reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals to provide equal access to services, programs and activities. ADS cannot assist retroactively, so it is generally best to request accommodations several weeks before the semester begins or as soon as a disability becomes known. Any student who needs accommodations should contact me as soon as possible so that I have sufficient time to make arrangements.

For assistance in obtaining an accommodation, contact Accessibility and Disability Service at 301-314-7682, or email them at [adsfrontdesk@umd.edu](adsfrontdesk@umd.edu). Information about sharing your accommodations with instructors, note taking assistance and more is available from the Counseling Center.

# Student Resources and Services

Taking personal responsibility for your own learning means acknowledging when your performance does not match your goals and doing something about it.  I hope you will come talk to me so that I can help you find the right approach to success in this course, and I encourage you to visit [UMD’s Student Academic Support Services website](http://tutoring.umd.edu) to learn more about the wide range of campus resources available to you.

In particular, everyone can use some help sharpening their communication skills (and improving their grade) by visiting [UMD’s Writing Center](http://www.english.umd.edu/academics/writingcenter/schedule) and schedule an appointment with the campus Writing Center.

You should also know there are a wide range of resources to support you with whatever you might need [UMD’s Student Resources and Services website](https://sph.umd.edu/content/student-resources-and-services) may help. If you feel it would be helpful to have someone to talk to, visit [UMD’s Counseling Center](https://www.counseling.umd.edu/) or [one of the many other mental health resources on campus](https://tltc.umd.edu/instructors/teaching-topics/supporting-whole-student).

## Basic Needs Security

If you have difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or lack a safe and stable place to live, please visit [UMD’s Division of Student Affairs website](https://studentaffairs.umd.edu/basic-needs-security) for information about resources the campus offers you and let me know if I can help in any way.

## Veteran Resources

UMD provides some additional supports to our student veterans. You can access those resources at the office of [Veteran Student life](https://stamp.umd.edu/engagement/veteran_student_life) and the [Counseling Center](https://www.counseling.umd.edu/aboutus/) Veterans and active duty military personnel with special circumstances (e.g., upcoming deployments, drill requirements, disabilities) are welcome and encouraged to communicate these, in advance if possible, to the instructor.

## Netiquette Policy [Optional]

Netiquette is the social code of online classes. Students share a responsibility for the course’s learning environment. Creating a cohesive online learning community requires learners to support and assist each other. To craft an open and interactive online learning environment, communication has to be conducted in a professional and courteous manner at all times, guided by common sense, collegiality and basic rules of etiquette.

### Participation

- Given the interactive style of this class, attendance will be crucial to note-taking and thus your performance in this class. Attendance is particularly important also because class discussion will be a critical component for your learning. 
- Each student is expected to make substantive contributions to the learning experience, and attendance is expected for every session. 
- Students with a legitimate reason to miss a live session should communicate in advance with the instructor, except in the case of an emergency. 
- Students who miss a live session are responsible for learning what they miss from that session. 
-- Additionally, students must complete all readings and assignments in a timely manner in order to fully participate in class. 

## Course Evaluation 

Please submit a course evaluation through Student Feedback on Course Experiences in order to help faculty and administrators improve teaching and learning at Maryland. All information submitted to Course Experiences is confidential. Campus will notify you when Student Feedback on Course Experiences is open for you to complete your evaluations at the end of the semester. Please go directly to the [Student Feedback on Course Experiences](http://courseexp.umd.edu/) to complete your evaluations. By completing all of your evaluations each semester, you will have the privilege of accessing through Testudo the evaluation reports for the thousands of courses for which 70% or more students submitted their evaluations.
